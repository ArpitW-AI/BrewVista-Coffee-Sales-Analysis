## ðŸ“Œ Project Background 
BrewVista is a fictitious coffee shop chain operating across three locations in New York City â€” Astoria, Hellâ€™s Kitchen, and Lower Manhattan. As a Data Consultant, I was tasked with extracting meaningfull insights from sale's data and providing actionable recommendations to improve performance across sales , product and marketing teams.

## Executive Summary
BrewVista earned **$698K** revenue (Janâ€“Jun 2023) with balanced sales across all stores. Sales **grew strongly** after February and peaked in June, though the pace has slowed. Beverages dominate with Coffee and Tea driving **66%** of revenue, while categories like Loose Tea and Packaged Chocolate remain weak. Astoria shows **steady demand** even with shorter hours, while evening traffic at Hellâ€™s Kitchen and Lower Manhattan **drops sharply**.
To build on these trends, BrewVista could run fresh promotions to sustain growth, rebrand or bundle underperforming categories, extend hours at Astoria, and close earlier at low-traffic stores to save costs.
